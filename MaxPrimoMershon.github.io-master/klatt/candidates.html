                        <li><strong>Dependability</strong>- Making good first impressions with new supervisors can make your entire transition run more smoothly. Temporary employees who are continuously punctual are asked back again and again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professionalism</strong>- Dressing for success, limiting personal calls and displaying a professional, helpful demeanor makes a long lasting impression on anyone you may meet on a job.</li>
                        <li><strong>Productivity</strong>- Employees who are efficient and productive are often asked back on new assignments with the same company. You can almost always avoid mistakes by asking questions first. Remember - most clients view questions as interest and concern about the work you are doing and the impression you are making on them. </li>
