            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 6, 2014 by <a href="#">Primo</a></p>
            <p>Despite the short week, lots of material was covered and a lot of lessons were learned. Here are the main things I took away from Week 2:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
                    <strong>User-Centered Design (UCD)</strong> - UCD is the process of designing a product around the needs and wants of users by focusing on them in each step of the process. Below is a summary of the UCD process:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Discover</li>
                        <li>Define</li>
                        <li>Design</li>
                        <li>Develop</li>
                        <li>Test</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
				<li><strong>Career Epiphany</strong> - During one of our career core sessions, we were asked personal questions about our expertise and enthusiasm, which caused me to have an epiphany about my career. I realized that I want to continue working in services, but at some sort of digital agency with a more creative, less corporate atmosphere where I get to work on projects in a variety of different industries. Also, I learned that my ideal work environment will be one where I work on projects collaboratively and cross functionally in teams, as well as being given work to complete on my own.</li>
				<li>
                    <strong>Situational Leadership</strong> - I have never really attended any kind of leadership workshop or training until our session on “Situational Leadership”, which I found incredibly informative. In this session we learned the importance of tailoring your leadership style for different types of situations. For every situation where you are a leader and people are reporting to you, it is important to first diagnose an individual’s need for direction/support and then use one of the four leadership styles accordingly:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Directing - High directive and low supportive behavior</li>
                        <li>Coaching - High directive and high supportive behavior</li>
                        <li>Supporting - Low directive and high supportive behavior</li>
                        <li>Delegating - Low directive and low supportive behavior</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
			</ul>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Startup Institute - Week 1</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 29, 2014 by <a href="#">Primo</a></p>
            <p>A wide array of material was covered in the first week at Startup Institute, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pursuing a Career in Startups</li>
				<li>Chicago Startup Ecosystem</li>
				<li>Intro to Lean Startup</li>
				<li>Intro to Emotional Intelligence</li>
				<li>Startup Financing</li>
				<li>Crafting a Career Theme</li>
				<li>Creative Confidence</li>
				<li>Viral Marketing</li>
				<li>Careers in Product & Design</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Needless to say I learned a lot, but here are the lessons that have stuck with me the most while reflecting back on my first week:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Just Do It</strong> - Ideas aren’t worth much. Ideas need to be turned into fact so they can be tested and then can be learned from. It’s important for startups to turn their ideas into facts by creating a minimal viable product (MVP) and continually iterating to improve the MVP using A/B testing.</li>
				<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> - It’s important to be able to understand one’s own and other’s emotions in order to guide the thinking and actions of oneself and others.</li>
				<li><strong>Figure It Out</strong> - In the startup world there is a “figure it out” mentality, where people don’t always know what they are doing, but they work smart with a trial and error approach in order to solve problems.</li>
				<li><strong>Advice to Aspiring Front End Developers</strong> - If somebody wants to pursue a job as a front end developer, it is important to have a portfolio with examples of work, stay up to date with the latest web/mobile trends, and have an eye for design.</li>
				<li><strong>My Personal Definition of Success</strong> - Solve problems that help people live fulfilling and prosperous lives while having fun doing it!</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>24 Hour Idea Hack</strong></p>
			<p>The biggest (and most fun!) event of the week was the Idea Hack, where our class was split up into teams and given 24 hours to solve some a problem for <a href="http://www.thinkchicago.net/">ThinkChicago</a>. Since there is the a gap between the supply and demand of the STEM job market in Chicago, ThinkChicago was created to attract and develop STEM talent for Chicago's tech ecosystem. My team, which was comprised of one Technical Marketing, two Product & Design, and two Web Development students, came up with the idea to create an online platform that will allow ThinkChicago to bridge the gap between students and startups by setting up events in Chicago and on college campuses. The events are created on the platform by ThinkChicago, which then allows students and startups to sign up for them. Additionally, startups create open roles they need to fill with the required skills while students create a basic profile and apply for roles that they match with based on their skills. I created a rough HTML/CSS prototype of the platform, which can be found live online <a href="http://maxprimomershon.com/IdeaHackTeam4/">here</a> and on my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/MaxPrimoMershon/MaxPrimoMershon.github.io/tree/master/IdeaHackTeam4">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 22, 2014 by <a href="#">Primo</a></p>
            <p>Summary of the Product & Design track prework:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Learned to set up a development environment and Github</strong> - Set up a domain & pointed it to Github, configured GitHub on Windows, created a git repository and committed changes to files in repository using Git Bash. </li>
				<li><strong>Learned basic of HTML5</strong> - Structured content of two basic websites, a <a href="http://maxprimomershon.com/coffee/">coffee shop website</a> and this blog, using HTML5.</li>
